      Tested in Chrome.
      Buggy, will autosave, refresh.

Notes from microjam:
  spread() crashes
  click thumbnail to edit it
  copy paste expressions (references break)
  double click to edit attribute label
  drop attribute feedback
  new lines in text
  path with line
  any shape should be an implicit group
  duplicate feature


  tutorial
    clock
    plot sine wave
    polygon
    mention precision





Priority Features:

Arrow keys between code fields
Import file (like load file but add it to the current toolbox)
Create Path, Add Anchor menu items (in lieu of pen tool)
Better naming/labeling system (Figure A, Rectangle 3, etc.)
  Count all the Elements with the same label that are previous (in "document" order) and then number the element accordingly.
Show "context" in attribute (element where a token came from)
  Need to disambiguate with name clashes




Features:

Export for embedding on the web
Pen tool
Bezier curves
Shadows
Gradients
Multiple fills and strokes
Images
Videos
Constrain attributes/variables within a range
Import JSON data
Multitouch support
Color picker
Richer text support
  Scrubbable numbers on canvas if text string is a number
  Edit text directly on canvas (need to emulate text cursor)


Useability:

Autocomplete
  highlight (as in hover) attribute when its selected in autocomplete menu
  better styling for "create variable"
  autocomplete built-in functions (sin, etc)
  click an option to autocomplete
Keyboard events
  Cmd+z to undo
  Other shortcuts based on menubar
Create panel thumbnails should have auto view matrix
Variable manipulation
  Remove a variable
  Reorder/reparent variable
  Reset a variable/attribute (e.g. by empty string in expression)
Better display of expression values
  highlight the appropriate spread selection (and hover)
  click to select that particular element
Add thumbnails to Outline
Resize right panel



Cleanup:

Integrate control points into e.g. Model.Shape
  Smells: returning {} object, mutating it at Element and Canvas.
Picture view
  Need to figure out all the different thumbnail needs, then refactor
Rename
  Node.children -> childNodes
  Node.childrenOfType -> childNodesVarying
Attribute/CompiledExpression
Build process
  React is off on its own
  vendor is hard-coded
  font css is separate
  built css has references into node_modules (for code mirror)
Can AttributeLabel and AttributeToken be merged?
Make consistent: first get @props, then @context in views
Clean up Model.coffee
Get rid of all get* methods (eliminate the get prefix)
Get rid of Util.mouseDownPreventDefault
DragManager.isConsummated, not consummated




Optimizations:

Get rid of try-catch for dependency management
  Nested spreads seem to slow things down considerably. I'm not sure if it's all the nested try-catch statements or what. One way to avoid having try-catch to determine spread dependencies would be if cells manually declared their cell dependencies. That is, each cell would have a function for running it and a function that would return a list of cells it depends on. Then when you evaluate, you'd first evaluate the dependencies and if any of those were spreads you would spread the function in question.
