# Introduction

The *node* is the *foundational abstraction* for managing the *scene graph* of
diagrams as well as the *inheritance hierarchy*.

The scene graph is managed through parent and children relationships. This is
very much like the DOM: every node can have 0 or 1 parent and the `addChild`
and `removeChild` methods ensure that all the parent/children pointers point
at the right thing.

Nodes can have properties in addition to children. These are managed simply as
javascript properties on the node objects.

Inheritance is handled a little differently. To reduce confusion, we use a
different nomenclature than class-instance or prototype-??. We call a node a
*master* and say that it can have *variants*. You can create a new variant
simply by calling the `createVariant` method.

The master-variant relationship is similar to the prototype relationship.
Indeed we use javascript's built-in prototype tree, so if A is the master of
B, then B.__proto__ == A. Thus properties inherit as in prototypal inheritance.

Children, however, inherit a little differently. Specifically, the entire
scene graph *structure* is also inherited.

So when you create a variant of a node, you also implicitly create
corresponding variants of each of the node's children and so on recursively.
That is, you create a deep clone of the node in such a way that every created
node has as its master the analogous node in the original tree. So if I have a
node A with children B and C and I create a variant of A called A', then A'
will automatically have as its children B' and C' which are variants of B and
C respectively.

Additionally, every variant node also has a pointer to its *head*. The head is
the root of the cloned tree. So if I have Node A with child Node B and I
create a variant of A to make A' with child B', then both A' and B' will have
as their head A'. We keep track of this in order to find *analogous* nodes
from one tree to another.


# Overriding

In addition to a variant overriding properties of its master, as in normal
prototypal inheritance, a variant can also override the children structure of
its master. That is, you can add and remove children from the variant. These
changes *will not* propagate back up to the master. However, changes made to a
master (adding and removing children) *will* propagate down to its variants.


# Lazy Implementation

We use a lazy implementation in order to support infinite recursion. An
example of recursion would be Node A has as a child Node A' which is a clone
of A. You can follow the children down as far as you want to go (by calling
Node.children() recursively), but the system won't crash by trying to create
an infinite data structure.

We achieve this with a "thunk" strategy. When Nodes are initially created they
are "eggs". It is only when they are asked about their children that they
"hatch" and instantiate their children. (And their children are instantiated
as eggs, of course.)

We want consumers of this API to never know that the implementation is lazy.
It should appear that you can just access Node.children(), etc. and always get
back the correct Node(s), as if we had infinite memory. Thus we need to hatch
the appropriate Node(s) when certain calls are made--basically whenever we go
"down" the tree.
